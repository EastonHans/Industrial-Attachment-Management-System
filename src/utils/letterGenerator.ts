To Whom It May Concern,

Dear Sir/Madam,

Re: Attachment/Internship for: ${studentName}\nRegistration No.: ${registrationNumber}

The above named is a ${year} year student taking a four-year Degree programme at The Catholic University of Eastern Africa in the Faculty of Science, Department of Computer and Information Science. The student is taking a Bachelor of Science in ${program}.

The Faculty believes that through Industrial attachments/internships the students will be able to tap a wide range of experience, skills and knowledge that would be difficult to replicate in a classroom setting or through written material alone.

To expedite the process, we are therefore, requesting you to consider our student for attachment within the months of ${attachmentPeriod} 2024 when on long vacation and perhaps, let us know how we can proceed to establish the envisaged inter-organization linkage.

I highly recommend the student for any attachment that may exist in your esteemed firm.
